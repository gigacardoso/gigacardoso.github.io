                    <h2>Combining the best of old &amp; new</h2>
<p>New World Whisky began in 2004 with a chance meeting at a whisky distillery. That meeting changed my life. Everything about whisky captivated me: the product, the process and of course the opportunity. Since then I have devoted my life to developing a modern whisky from Australia. A spirit we can offer the world with pride.</p>
<p>Unshackled from tradition, our quest was to discover what whisky could be. Taking the best of the old world and marrying it with the best Australia has to offer: our ingredients, our&nbsp;climate and our people.<br>
The result is a unique world class malt which I am truly proud of.</p>

                    <h1 class="pageTitle">Our History</h1>
                    <h2>In search of a new horizon</h2>
<p>The beginnings of the New World Whisky Distillery are like any good traveller’s tale. David Vitale needed a new frontier. After 8 years developing his e-learning business in Melbourne he wanted a change. Looking for a quieter life, David moved to&nbsp;Tasmania with his fiancé.</p>
<p>David initially wanted to create an organic brewery. But a chance meeting&nbsp;at a micro-distillery&nbsp;captured David’s imagination for whisky and led to a handshake agreement to return to Melbourne and&nbsp;start a new distillery with some local investors. That was 2004.&nbsp; As with most early stage start-ups, it has been a white-knuckled experience, but through determination and a certain amount of luck, New World Whisky Distillery has released its first product a world class premium malt whisky – Starward.</p>
<p>Now in it’s&nbsp;fourth year of production, the distillery has evolved into one of Australia’s leading producers of premium whisky and prides itself on challenging conventional perceptions of what whisky can be. Just like the country in which its made, Starward is youthful, rich and bright. It’s a testament to our team, built around a simple vision of offering the world an exceptional&nbsp;modern whisky.</p>

                    <h2>Creating a modern whisky</h2>
<p>Starting a distillery with a blank sheet of paper is both refreshing and daunting. A whisky unshakled from tradition needs to play to the strengths of the place and the people making it.</p>
<p>For nine years our&nbsp;team, led by our founder and CEO&nbsp;has experimented with barley and barrels. We have adopted, adjusted and re-adjusted brewing, distilling and maturation techniques while observing the influence of time, place and the natural elements.</p>
<p>We’ve worked with our maltster and use a bespoke Australian malted barley to suit our requirements – a balanced cereal note providing a full mouthfeel, and a blend of yeasts to create our unique orchard fruit aroma. We hand select Australian fortified wine barrels that are painstainkingly re-coopered, re-toasted and re-sized for aging our spirit extracting dried fruit, spice and more sweetness.&nbsp; Melbourne’s climate – with it’s highly variable temperature range – mellows the whisky, maturing quicker than its northern hemisphere peers, without compromising quality.</p>
<p>The result is Starward. A modern whisky which borrows from the past without being constrained by it, and combines it with the best Australia has to offer; our ingredients, our climate and our people.</p>

                    <h1 class="pageTitle">Buy Our Whisky</h1>
                    <h2>Become a Barrel Owner</h2>
<p>To enable New World Whisky Distillery to keep up with the growing global demand for premium whisky we operate a purchase program for our immature whisky. The program is structured to enable supporters of our business to participate in the production of our world class whiskies by sharing in our distillery’s future expansion. Opportunities exist for capital growth or outright ownership.</p>
<p>If you choose to keep the whisky, we will organise packaging, taxes, and shipping the bottles to you once the product is mature. However if you choose to sell the whisky back to New World Whisky Distillery, we’ll give you a locked in premium on your purchase price.</p>
<p>Each and every barrel crafted by New World Whisky Distillery is held under the supervision of the Australian Customs &amp; Excise Division of the Australian Taxation Office. Every owner of our immature whisky receives full documentation covering ownership, identifying location of each barrel by number, size and date of filling. Each owner receives a signed certificate containing this information.</p>
<p>Our whiskies are matured in a range of barrel sizes which enable us to decant whisky in different (but pre-defined) time frames, providing you with a fixed return should you choose to enter into an agreement to sell your barrel of whisky back to the distillery. This agreement is formalised in a Put and Call Contract which is signed at the time of purchase, providing both the distillery and the investor with clarity and peace of mind.</p>
<p>Currently, the annualised return offered to investors for purchasing our immature whisky is calculated at a premium of at least 5.0% above the RBA Cash Rate and is reviewed monthly.</p>
<p>This is attractive to both individuals seeking an innovative yet secure form of asset ownership, or a self managed superannuation fund that is looking for a secure, diversified portfolio of assets. You can purchase as little as one barrel for $3,000.00, but typically investors purchase in lots of 5 or 10 barrels.</p>
<p>For further information please fill in your details below and a copy of our information memorandum and application form will be available for you to download immediately. Alternatively, you can contact us directly and we’ll be happy to answer your questions.</p>
